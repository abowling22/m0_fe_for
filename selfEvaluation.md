# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?
I feel better than when I started. The last problem was a signfiicant challenge for me, but doing it really helped me break down each piece of the puzzle in a way that I understand how each piece is effecting the final outcome. I hope this comes across in my loom video.
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
It was hard, defenitly used all my resources (other students, and google) to learn. This was very hard.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that? 
I need to keep doing them. I understand the pieces of this for statement now, but repitiation and the ability to do do the syntax aspects from memory is something practice will help with.
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
I dont have any questions, my brain is mush.
